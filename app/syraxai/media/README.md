# SyraxAI Media Files

This directory contains all media assets for the SyraxAI website.

## Directory Structure

- `/images`: For all static images (logos, icons, screenshots, etc.)
- `/videos`: For video content

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep file names descriptive and use kebab-case (e.g., `trading-interface-screenshot.png`)
2. Optimize images before adding them to reduce load times
3. For larger files, consider using a CDN and referencing the URL instead
4. Organize images in subdirectories if the number of assets grows significantly
